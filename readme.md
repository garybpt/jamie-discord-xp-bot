## Setup Guide

Welcome to the setup guide for Discord Bot Name! This guide will walk you through the process of setting up the bot for your Discord server. One crucial part of the setup is configuring the .env file, which contains environment variables used by the bot.

**Prerequisites**

Before you begin, make sure you have:

1. A Discord account.
2. A Discord server where you have the necessary permissions to add bots.

**Step 1: Create a Bot**

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal.
2. Click on "New Application" and give your application a name (e.g., "My Discord Bot").
3. Under the "Bot" section, click "Add Bot."

**Step 2: Get Your Bot Token**

In the "Bot" section of your application, you'll see a "Token" section. Click "Copy" to copy your bot token.

**Step 3: Create a .env File**

In your bot's project directory, create a new file named .env. This file will store your environment variables.

**Step 4: Configure the .env File**

Open the .env file in a text editor and add the following environment variables:

DISCORD_TOKEN=your_bot_token_here
SERVER_ID=your_server_id_here
LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID=your_leaderboard_channel_id_here
ROLE_LVL5_ID=your_role_lvl5_id_here
ROLE_LVL10_ID=your_role_lvl10_id_here
ROLE_LVL25_ID=your_role_lvl25_id_here
ROLE_LVL50_ID=your_role_lvl50_id_here
ROLE_LVL100_ID=your_role_lvl100_id_here
ROLE_LVL500_ID=your_role_lvl500_id_here
ERROR_CHANNEL_ID=your_error_channel_id_here
DISCORD_TOKEN: Paste the bot token you copied earlier here. This token is required for your bot to log in and function.

1. SERVER_ID: Replace your_server_id_here with the ID of your Discord server. This ID is used to fetch server-specific information.
2. LEADERBOARD_CHANNEL_ID: Replace your_leaderboard_channel_id_here with the ID of the channel where you want the weekly leaderboard to be posted.
3. ROLE_LVL5_ID, ROLE_LVL10_ID, ROLE_LVL25_ID, ROLE_LVL50_ID, ROLE_LVL100_ID, ROLE_LVL500_ID: Replace these variables with the role IDs you want to assign to users when they reach specific XP levels.
4. ERROR_CHANNEL_ID: Replace your_error_channel_id_here with the ID of the channel where the bot should log errors and issues.

**Step 5: Save the .env File**

After configuring the .env file, save it.

**Step 6: Customize Roles (Optional)**

If you want to assign roles based on XP levels, make sure to define the XP thresholds and corresponding role IDs in the .env file under the ROLE_LVLX_ID variables.

**Step 7: Invite the Bot to Your Server**

1. Go to the Discord Developer Portal.
2. Select your bot application.
3. In the "OAuth2" section, under "OAuth2 URL Generator," select the scopes "bot" and "applications.commands."
4. Below, select the permissions your bot requires (e.g., "Read Messages," "Send Messages," etc.).
5. Copy the generated OAuth2 URL and open it in your web browser.
6. Select your Discord server from the dropdown menu and authorize the bot to join.

**Step 8: Run the Bot**

In your bot's project directory, run your bot script. It should log in and start functioning according to your configuration.

**Step 9: Customize Messages (Optional)**

If you want to customize level-up and role-assignment messages, you can modify the code of your bot to match your server's style and tone.

That's it! Your Discord Bot Name is now set up and ready to enhance your server's community engagement.
